# 📈 Univariate Linear Regression from Scratch

This project implements a univariate linear regression model from the ground up using Python, bypassing high-level libraries like scikit-learn to provide a clear, hands-on understanding of the algorithm's mechanics. It analyzes the relationship between `Attendance_Hours` and `Final_Marks` using the `Study_vs_Score_data.csv` dataset.

## 🧠 What This Project Covers

- **Pearson Correlation Coefficient**  
  Custom implementation to measure the linear relationship between variables.

- **Linear Regression Model**
  - Manual computation of model weights (slope and intercept)
  - Prediction using the regression equation \( y = wx + b \)
  - Cost function calculation (Mean Squared Error)
  - Gradient computation for optimization

- **Gradient Descent**  
  Applied to optimize model parameters.

- **Performance Evaluation**  
  Assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

- **Visualization**
  - Scatter plot of data with the fitted regression line
  - Training loss over iterations to show model convergence

## 🎯 Goal

To deeply understand linear regression by building its components from scratch, focusing on the underlying math and logic, and applying it to predict `Final_Marks` based on `Attendance_Hours`.

---

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python  
- NumPy (for basic array operations)  
- Pandas (for data handling)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)
