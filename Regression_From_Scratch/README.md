## üìä Regression Projects from Scratch | 2025

A self-driven journey to rebuild and understand core machine learning regression algorithms using only Python and NumPy ‚Äî no libraries like scikit-learn. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of regression, implemented and visualized from the ground up.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Linear Regression + Pearson Correlation
Built a simple linear regression model and implemented Pearson correlation manually.  
Used gradient descent and visualized the regression line on test data.  
- Tools: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- Topics: Gradient Descent, Loss Functions, Correlation




### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Polynomial Regression for Stock Price Prediction
Implemented polynomial regression with feature expansion and matrix-based training (normal equation).  
Applied to real stock price data and compared with scikit-learn's performance.  
- Tools: Python, NumPy, pandas, Seaborn  
- Topics: Polynomial Features, Model Evaluation, Overfitting


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Multivariate Linear Regression
Built a multivariable model using custom gradient descent.  
Preprocessed features (normalization), handled categorical data, and compared results to scikit-learn.  
- Tools: Python, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib  
- Topics: Feature Scaling, Multiple Variables, Performance Metrics
